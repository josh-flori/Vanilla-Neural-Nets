//////////  @Override is a Java annotation. It tells the compiler that the following method overrides a method of its superclass. For instance, say you implement a Person class. public class Person { public final String firstName; public final String lastName; //some methods @Override public boolean equals(Object other) { ... } }

 A PROTECTED member is accessible within all classes in the same package and within subclasses in other packages

////////// how a switch statement works is it has cases so if your id is called something
////////// like r.id.btn,.. when you tap on the button this figures out which is
////////// getting tapped. then you do something in that line of code
		
		
////////// PUBLIC means that the method is visible and can be called from other objects of other types. Other alternatives are private, protected, package and package-private. See here for more details.

////////// STATIC means that the method is associated with the class, not a specific instance (object) of that class. This means that you can call a static method without creating an object of the class.

////////// VOID means that the method has no return value. If the method returned an int you would write int instead of void.


////////// A PRIVATE member is only accessible within the same class as it is declared. A member with no access modifier is only accessible within classes in the same package. A protected member is accessible within all classes in the same package and within subclasses in other packages.

////////// CLASS

A class is a user defined blueprint from which objects are created.  It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. CLASSES INCLUDE:

MODIFYER : A class can be public or has default access (Refer this for details).
CLASS NAME: The name should begin with a initial letter (capitalized by convention).
SUPERCLASS (if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
INTERFACES (if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
BODY: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.


OBJECT - 
	state = attributes & properties (adjectives)... color, size, shape etc.
	identity = name
	Behavior = verbs, functions, etc
