### 3.1 - Zero-Padding
# GRADED FUNCTION: zero_pad

def zero_pad(X, pad):
    """
    Pad with zeros all images of the dataset X. The padding is applied to the height and width of an image, 
    as illustrated in Figure 1.
    
    Argument:
    X -- python numpy array of shape (m, n_H, n_W, n_C) representing a batch of m images
    pad -- integer, amount of padding around each image on vertical and horizontal dimensions
    
    Returns:
    X_pad -- padded image of shape (m, n_H + 2*pad, n_W + 2*pad, n_C)
    """

    """The main benefits of padding are the following:

    It allows you to use a CONV layer without necessarily shrinking the height and width of the volumes. This is important for building deeper networks, since otherwise the height/width 
    would shrink as you go to deeper layers. An important special case is the "same" convolution, in which the height/width is exactly preserved after one layer.

    It helps us keep more of the information at the border of an image. Without padding, very few values at the next layer would be affected by pixels as the edges of an image.

    Exercise: Implement the following function, which pads all the images of a batch of examples X with zeros. Use np.pad. Note if you want to pad the array "a" of shape 
    (5,5,5,5,5)(5,5,5,5,5)  with pad = 1 for the 2nd dimension, pad = 3 for the 4th dimension and pad = 0 for the rest, you would do:

    a = np.pad(a, ((0,0), (1,1), (0,0), (3,3), (0,0)), 'constant', constant_values = (..,..)) """

    Figure 2 : Convolution operation
    with a filter of 2x2 and a stride of 1 (stride = amount you move the window each time you slide)
    In a computer vision application, each value in the matrix on the left corresponds to a single pixel value, and we convolve a 3x3 filter with the image by multiplying its values
    element-wise with the original matrix, then summing them up and adding a bias. In this first step of the exercise, you will implement a single step of convolution, corresponding to
    applying a filter to just one of the positions to get a single real-valued output.

    Later in this notebook, you'll apply this function to multiple positions of the input to implement the full convolutional operation."""
